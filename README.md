# ðŸŽ¥ðŸ¤– Cinephile Bot
A Twitter bot that replies to user query tweets and presents them with standard information about films
such as year of release, budget, box office, director(s), actor(s) etc.

*Note: This program uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb*

## Features
* Uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to push my bot's Docker image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) whenever code is pushed into the `master` branch
* Contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook to:
    1. Dynamically provision a single AWS EC2 instance (default configuration is `t2.micro` running `Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM)` in region `us-east-2`) ([AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) eligible)
    2. Installs Docker CE on the instance
    3. Pulls the Docker image mentioned above, and runs a container for it
* Uses [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) to encrypt my AWS access key and secret key so they are not exposed to the public, but can be stored directly on GitHub
* Uses the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API v3](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to process a user's query, retrieve movie data, and tweet a response

## Requirements
Must have an AWS account and an IAM user with *access key ID* and *secret access key* credentials

**TODO: Include GIF/Screenshot here**

## Usage
First, install Ansible and associated dependencies on the control machine
```bash
$ sudo apt install python
$ sudo apt install python-pip
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install boto boto3 ansible
```

Then, generate an RSA public/private key pair for your AWS EC2 instance
```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/rsa_aws
```

After cloning the directory, store the IAM user credentials securely using ```ansible-vault```
```bash
$ cd ansible/
$ ansible-vault create group_vars/all/credentials.yml
$ ansible-vault edit group_vars/all/credentials.yml
```
Example ```credentials.yml``` file 
```
aws_access_key: AAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBB
aws_secret_key: afjdfadgf$fgajk5ragesfjgjsfdbtirhf
```
**Note**: these credentials are examples only


Now, run the playbook to deploy an instance and run a Docker container for the Twitter
bot on your newly provisioned AWS EC2 instance
```bash
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass --tags create_ec2
```
